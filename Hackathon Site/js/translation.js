//initialize dictionary of text, site_text = {}, first slot as english, second slot as chinese

//check if flag is english (0) or chinese (1)
//if flag is 0, set flag to 1
//else set flag to 0

//iterate through every element in class text
//use innerhtml to reassign each value ex: element.innerHTML = site_text.i[1]
